**Objective**
To develop a simple quiz game that presents multiple choice questions to the user.The game keeps track of the user's score and provides feedback based on their answers.


**Key Activities**
- *Understanding the problem:* The quiz game requires multiple-choice questions, user input, score tracking, and feedback.
- *Program designing:* Structure of the program and planning on how to display questions and collecting answers from the user is done. Also, framework for feedback mechanism and score tracking is also designed.
- *Development environment:* Choosing a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the next step. A C compiler should be available for compiling and executing the program.
- *Testing the program:* The program is compiled to check for syntax errors and it is tested with various inputs to ensure the program runs as expected.
- *De-bugging the program:* The program is checked for any bugs and the code is refined to handle edge cases.


**Technologies used**
- *C Programming language*
- *VSS Code*
